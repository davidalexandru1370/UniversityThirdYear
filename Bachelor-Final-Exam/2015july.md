OS:

3. 1

a. 6 child processes 
```
       P
 /  /  | \  \  \
C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6
```

b. 7, The program creates 6 pipes, each one sending sequentially from 0->1..->5->0 an integer value which is increased before sending to next pipe

c.
``` write 1 to pipe 0
read 1 from pipe 0 and write 2 to pipe 2 (i = 0)
block to read from pipe 1 (i = 1)
read 2 from pipe 2 and write 3 to pipe 4 (i = 2)
block to read from pipe 3 (i = 3)
read 3 from pipe 4 and write 4 to pipe 0 (i = 4)
block to read from pipe 5
```
So there are 3 blocking calls which are not handled, while the parent process is blocked at system call wait(0) => deadlock
 

3.2

a. It will iterate through every file which ends in .log, get into variable A the number of lines which contains the word ERROR, then in variable M will add the variable A, then in variable B will count the segmentation fault errors and add them in variable N. At the end it will print procentage how much of the total errors are segmentation faults.

b. At the end it will print procentage how much of the total errors are segmentation faults.

c. It will put the result of the grep operation which searches for lines containg the ERROR keyword then any characters then the keyword segmentation fault, pipe it to wc and count the number the lines.

d. \ character is needed in order to apply the multiplication operation
