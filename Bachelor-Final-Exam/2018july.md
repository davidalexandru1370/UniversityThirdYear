DB:

1. primary keys: TId, PId, (Team1Id, Team2Id, Date)
   foreign keys: TeamId, Team1Id, Team2Id
2. {Country, City, NumberOfSeats} -> {Stadium}
   {Stadium} -> {NumberOfSeats, City, Country}
   {Country} -> {Continent}

3. a because 3rd normal form does not allow functional dependencies which are not part of the super key({Country} -> {Continent})

c. 3rd normal form does not allow functional dependencies which are not part of the super key({Stadium} -> {NumberOfSeats, City, Country})

4. Select P.Name from Players P join Teams T on T.TeamId where T.Continent = 'Asia' and P.NumberOfMatches > 100

5. Select T.Country, Count(*) as NoMatches from Teams T, Matches M where T.id = M.Team1Id or T.Id = Matches.Team2Id
Group By T.Country

 ```
b. it will write x in the fifo p and then it will block on read from fifo q because nobody writes in it

c. in the first process it will open p for read and q for write, then it will write x in q and wait to read from p
while in the second process it will open p for write and q for reading, it will write y in p and wait to read from q. The final output will be x y, not exactly in this order.

d. In one process it will open p for read and q for write, whereas in the other process it will open q for read and p for write. The first process will write in q and read from p while the second process will write in

p1: opens p for reading and q for writing

p2: opens q for reading and p for writing

2. This program will print every import line from c, cpp and .h files printing every library in alphabetical order. So for example for the file
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
```
will print:
algorithm
vector

The third line will match only lines starting with "#include.*<" so every import line starting with #include, then any number >= 0 of characters and ending with <. This input is piped to a sed command which will print the content between <> by capturing it into paranthesis and printing it.
