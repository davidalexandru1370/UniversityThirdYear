```cpp
int main() {
    int f, r, x, p[2];
    x = getpid();
    pipe(p);
    f = fork();

    if (x == getpid()) // 1st if
        close(p[1]);

    if (f == 0 && x == getpid()) { // 2nd if
        close(p[0]);
        write(p[1], &x, sizeof(x));
    }

    if (f > 0) // 3rd if
        read(p[0], &r, sizeof(r));

    if (getppid() == x && f > 0) { // 4th if
        close(p[1]);
        read(p[0], &r, sizeof(r));
        printf("%d\n", r);
        exit(0);
    }

    if (x == getppid()) { // 5th if
        close(p[0]);
        f++;
        write(p[1], &f, sizeof(f));
        exit(0);
    }
    if (getppid() == 0) // 6th if
        printf("%d\n", f);
    
    printf("%d\n", r);
}
```

a. in variable x we are storing the parent process id and in the variable f we are storing the child process id in the parent process and 0 in the child process

b. 
- the first if will execute only in the parent process
- the second if will not be executed because f == 0 means child process but x == getpid() will return false, because getpid() will return pid of child process, whereas x contains the pid of the parent process
- the third if will be executed in the parent process
- the fourth if will not be executed, because in the parent process getppid() == x will assert false, whereas in the child process getppid() == x will be true, but f > 0 will assert false.
- the fifth if will be executed only by the child process.
- the sixth if will not be executed.

c. It will print 1 because in the fifth if we will write (f = 0) + 1 in the pipe and read it in the third if and print it at the final of the program.

```bash
m tmp
echo -n > tmp
for f in $*
do
    if test ! -f $f
    then
        echo $f does not exist as a file
    continue
    fi
    rm $f
    if [ ! -f $f ]
    then
        echo $f has been deleted successfully
    fi
    ls $f >> tmp
done
x=`cat tmp | grep -c ^.*$`
echo result: $x
```

a. there is no difference because on line 5 we are explicitelly using the test command, whereas on line 11 we are using test command under the hood of the [ ] evaluator

b. x will contain the number of matching lines from content of tmp 

c. backwards tilde `` will replace the command with its output

d. if rm $f
