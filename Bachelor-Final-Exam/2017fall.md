b. The first child process C1 will execute line 11. The value for m1 will be the pid of process C2 sent by process C2 through pipe.

c. The second child process C2 will execute line 19. The value for m2 wil be the pid of process C1 sen by process through pipe.

a. f will iterate through every file which ends in .txt, namely abc.txt, ubb.txt and ab.txt

b. \*ubb.txt\*, ab.txt because the grep from second line will consider only files which are text files, then the grep from the third line will consider only textfiles which contains at least one match for a line starting with different character than the first passed argument, in this case 'a'.

c. the grep from 3rd line will be run in quiet mode, so no output, and will search for lines starting with a character different than the first command line argument. The grep from 6th line will consider only files which name starts with the first command line argument.

d. bcd.txt, text file with content:
    abc
    bcb
    bbb
